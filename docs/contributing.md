# Contributing

Welcome! This project uses a multi-agent review system to ensure code quality, security, and correctness. Before you start, please read this guide and the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for procedural details.

## Agent Routing Matrix

Before implementing any changes, identify which agents match the files you plan to touch using the routing matrix below. Read those agent files before writing code, and note them in your PR description as:

```
Consulted: <agent-name> per routing matrix
```

| Path glob | Agent(s) to consult before editing | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `sidecar/src/telemetry.rs`, `sidecar/src/forza_*.rs` | `telemetry-expert` | Packet schema is the source of truth; agent file must stay in sync with code |
| `sidecar/src/heuristics/**`, `sidecar/src/recommendations/**` | `race-engineer` + `telemetry-expert` | Tuning logic must reflect real-world practice + correct telemetry semantics |
| `sidecar/src/storage*.rs`, `sidecar/migrations/**` | `architect` | Schema migrations need ADR consideration |
| `docs/adr/**` (new files) | `architect` | New ADRs need review against existing decisions |
| `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**` | `devops-engineer` + `security-review` | CI/CD correctness + security (covered by devops-review.yml and security-review.yml) |
| Any file with auth, secrets, OIDC, crypto in name or context | `security-review` | OWASP / Zero Trust pass |
| New crates, new public modules, new sidecar tests | `qa-engineer` | Test strategy + coverage |
| `overlay/**` (logic changes, not pure CSS) | `qa-engineer` | Overlay test discipline (vitest) |

## Automated Agent Review Workflows

Four path-scoped review workflows enforce this matrix on every PR:

| Workflow | Check name | In-scope when |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/security-review.yml` | `security-review verdict` | Workflow/action files, shell scripts, or security-sensitive file names change |
| `.github/workflows/qa-review.yml` | `qa-review verdict` | `sidecar/src/**` or `overlay/**` changes without accompanying test-file changes |
| `.github/workflows/telemetry-review.yml` | `telemetry-review verdict` | `sidecar/src/telemetry.rs`, `sidecar/src/forza_*.rs`, or `telemetry-expert.agent.md` changes |
| `.github/workflows/heuristics-review.yml` | `heuristics-review verdict` | `sidecar/src/heuristics/**`, `sidecar/src/recommendations/**`, or `race-engineer.agent.md` changes |

All four follow the skip-success pattern: out-of-scope PRs post `success` so the checks can be required in branch protection without blocking unrelated work.

## PR Description Requirements

- List which agent(s) you consulted per the routing matrix.
- Summarize the changes and affected areas.
- If your PR triggers an agent review workflow, address any findings before merge.

## Additional Guidelines

- Follow the [tech-writer conventions](../tech-writer.agent.md) for documentation changes.
- For architectural decisions, draft ADRs in `docs/adr/` and consult the `architect` agent.
- For test coverage, ensure new public functions/modules have corresponding tests; otherwise, the `qa-review` workflow will request changes.
