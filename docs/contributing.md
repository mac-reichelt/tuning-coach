# Contributing Guide

This project uses agent-driven review workflows to maintain quality, correctness, and security. Follow these steps to contribute effectively.

## Agent Routing Matrix

Before implementing changes, identify which agents match the files you plan to touch. Consult the relevant agent files and note them in your PR description:

```
Consulted: <agent-name> per routing matrix
```

| Path glob | Agent(s) to consult before editing | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `sidecar/src/telemetry.rs`, `sidecar/src/forza_*.rs` | `telemetry-expert` | Packet schema is the source of truth; agent file must stay in sync with code |
| `sidecar/src/heuristics/**`, `sidecar/src/recommendations/**` | `race-engineer` + `telemetry-expert` | Tuning logic must reflect real-world practice + correct telemetry semantics |
| `sidecar/src/storage*.rs`, `sidecar/migrations/**` | `architect` | Schema migrations need ADR consideration |
| `docs/adr/**` (new files) | `architect` | New ADRs need review against existing decisions |
| `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**` | `devops-engineer` + `security-review` | CI/CD correctness + security (covered by devops-review.yml and security-review.yml) |
| Any file with auth, secrets, OIDC, crypto in name or context | `security-review` | OWASP / Zero Trust pass |
| New crates, new public modules, new sidecar tests | `qa-engineer` | Test strategy + coverage |
| `overlay/**` (logic changes, not pure CSS) | `qa-engineer` | Overlay test discipline (vitest) |

## Automated Agent Review Workflows

Four path-scoped review workflows enforce this matrix on every PR:

| Workflow | Check name | In-scope when |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/security-review.yml` | `security-review verdict` | Workflow/action files, shell scripts, or security-sensitive file names change |
| `.github/workflows/qa-review.yml` | `qa-review verdict` | `sidecar/src/**` or `overlay/**` changes without accompanying test-file changes |
| `.github/workflows/telemetry-review.yml` | `telemetry-review verdict` | `sidecar/src/telemetry.rs`, `sidecar/src/forza_*.rs`, or `telemetry-expert.agent.md` changes |
| `.github/workflows/heuristics-review.yml` | `heuristics-review verdict` | `sidecar/src/heuristics/**`, `sidecar/src/recommendations/**`, or `race-engineer.agent.md` changes |

Out-of-scope PRs post a passing check so these can be required in branch protection without blocking unrelated work.

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Consulted agent files per routing matrix
- [ ] Added or updated tests for new public functions/modules
- [ ] Documented new features or API changes in `/docs` and `README.md`
- [ ] Filled out PR template, listing consulted agents

## Agent Review Outcomes

Agent reviews post a verdict (`APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `COMMENT`) and findings as a PR review and check-run. Address any `REQUEST_CHANGES` before merging.

## Additional Guidelines

- Use active voice and present tense in documentation.
- Link all new concepts to their definitions.
- Do not document features that do not exist yet.
